# Library

This is the main directory for storing files.

To add via your terminal:

1) Clone this repository to your local directory
> git clone https://github.com/Beaucheminlab/Library.git

2) Edit inside Library
> cp ... Library
> cd Library
> emacs ...

_Inside Library/_:

3) Add changes to git // this queues your changes to be uploaded
> git add *

4) (Optional) Remove repeated content
> git rm ...

5) Commit changes (add message here with "-m" key or git will ask you to do that as an additional step via vim) // this uploads the changes to server
> git commit -m "edited code"

6) Finalize changes by pushing the changed version into the repo
> git push -u origin master
